An asset metadata is an '''optional''' JSON object that can be added to an asset transaction. All asset metadata are stored in [[Benefits#use-of-torrent-files|Torrent files]].

The following JSON keys are recognized by the new colored coins protocol:

<pre>{
  data: {
    Asset_ID: String,
    Asset_name: String,
    Asset_Genesis: {block, tx},
    Issuer: String,
    Description: String,
    URLs: [{name,url,data_hash}],
    user_data: {}
    }
  rules: {
    fees: [{}],
    expiration: {},
    minters: [{}],
    holders: [{}]   
        }
}</pre>
All the above keys are optional. Moreover, even though the basic colored coins code will ignore other keys, any one can fork the colored coins [https://github.com/colored-coins opensource code] and add supporting logic for more keys.

The metadata consists of two parts: Data and Rules.
