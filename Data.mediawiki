= Data =

This part of the metadata includes optional static data fields. Currently the colored coins implementation recognizes the following keys:

== The Asset ID ==

Including the [[Asset%20ID|Asset ID]] is optional but can expedite processing. ## Asset Name A free string ## Asset Genesis This field is required only upon re-issuance of an asset by a [[Metadata#minters|minter]], regardless of whether the asset is [[Benefits#coherent-issuance-policy|locked or unlocked]]. The genesis field stores the block and transaction ids of the issuance transaction. ## Issuer A free string describing the Asset's issuer ## Description A free string describing the Asset ## URLs An array of JSON objects, each containing a link to a torrent file that contain data about the asset. The link includes * Name * [[Benefits#use-of-torrent-files|Torrent file]] URL * SHA-256 hash of the metadata (verifying that the torrent data is correct).

For example, a data field tied to an asset might be the legal contract describing the issuer's promise to redeem each unit for goods or services in the real world. Both issuers and holders of an asset can refer unambiguously to the original contract against which the asset was issued.

== User data ==

A free data field to be used by the issuer
